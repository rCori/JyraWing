# JyraWing
A Fake NES Shmup made in Unity

JyraWing is intended to recreate an older style of shmup reminicent more of the likes of Gradius or R-Type than the more modern bullet-hell or "danmaku" style stg game. Those games offer something to a very specific type of dedicated player and can scare away people who are not ingrained the genre.

That was not always the case. The games the pioneered the genre in arcades and early consoles were meant to be approachable but challenging for everybody. This style of game has fallen to the wayside in favor of the hardcore bullet hell games in the independant scene where serving a niche is acceptable and common. There is also the belief that non hardcore players can't care about a shmup at all anymore.

With JyraWing I hope to harken back to those older style games. I believe that if made correctly and presented the right way a wider group of people can enjoy these games again. I have decided for a number of reasons that the game will be horizontal scrolling rather than vertical scrolling and that the athstetic of the game will have a "retro" feel. The game is still early in development so anything is subject to change.

JyraWing is not supposed to be an "Indie Game" or a "Retro Game" or some other tight categorization. It's just a game that I personally want to make. It is still far to early to determine what, if any monetization or distribution methods will be used.
